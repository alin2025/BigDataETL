## Tools and Technologies

This repository leverages a variety of big data tools and technologies, including:

- **MariaDB**: An open-source relational database management system.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- **Hive Metastore**: A service to manage the metadata of Hive tables.
- **Apache Spark**: A unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
- **Python**: A high-level programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Apache Airflow**: A platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.
- **Trino**: A distributed SQL query engine for big data.
- **Apache NiFi**: A data integration and ETL tool that supports data routing, transformation, and system mediation.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability.
- **Elasticsearch**: A distributed search and analytics engine.
- **Kibana**: A visualization tool that works with Elasticsearch to explore, visualize, and share insights from data.

Each project in this repository is organized into separate directories. 
Each directory contains all the necessary files, including scripts, configuration files, and documentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alin2025/BigDataETL.git
    cd BigDataETL
    ```

2. **Set Up Project Environments**: Navigate to the specific project directory you want to work on and follow the setup instructions provided in the project's `README.md` file. Each project may require specific tools or configurations, so be sure to check the requirements.

3. **Install Dependencies**: If the project includes a `requirements.txt` file or equivalent, install the necessary dependencies. For example, if it's a Python project, you can use:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Project**: Follow the steps outlined in the project's `README.md` file to run the project. This might involve setting up databases, starting services, or running scripts.

5. **Explore and Modify**: Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and experiment with different configurations. Each project is designed to be a learning experience and a demonstration of best practices in big data engineering.
